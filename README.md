# Ouroboros - CNAM Project

### A small game using the player's movements to move a character in a labyrinth.

We use Python for the first game screen.
MediaPipe allows us to detect the hand of the player and to discover the card thanks to its movement.

We also use Processing (Java) for the second game screen.
Thanks to OpenCV, we detect the player's movements.
He can move the character on the screen touching the areas on the screen.
